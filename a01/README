CIS*2520		Assignment 1 Four Way Stop Simulation
June 4 2018			rdecastr@uoguelph.ca
****************************************************


************************
Program Description
**************************
 This program implements a simple four way stop simulation. All requirements from the assignment are followed.

 **Special Rules for traffic:
 1.If two cars coming from opposite directions(N & S, E & W) arrive at the front of the queue at the same time:
  E goes first. W goes second
  N goes first. S goes second
 2.If four cars coming from different directions(N, S, E, W) arrive at the front of the queue at the same time:
  N goes first. Then Ontario right of way rules applies again.


************
Compilation
************
 To compile this code:
 run: make

 To compile the testing program:
 run: make test

  Detailed Make options:

  make  compiles the main.c program with the library
  make cppcheck runs the cppcheck option
  make test compiles the testing.c program with the library
  make clean removes executable files

************
Execution
************
 To execute main:
 run: ./bin/runMe assets/"filename"

 To execute test:
 run: ./bin/testMe

************
Complexity
************
initializeQueue
  O(1) - only goes through the function to initialize queue and its members. Its complexity does not depend on the size of sample input.
deleteQueue
  O(N) - deletes every node through a for loop. Complexity depends on the size of sample input.
enQueue
  O(1) - only adds one node to the queue. Its complexity does not depend on the size of sample input.
deQueue
  O(1) - only removes one node from the queue. Its complexity does not depend on the size of sample input.
peekQueue
  O(1) - only looks at one node of the queue. Its complexity does not depend on the size of sample input.
printQueue
  O(N) - goes through every node to print. Complexity depends on the size of sample input or size of queue.
